# CS6208 Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence

This course covers advanced topics in artificial intelligence that are of current research or application interests. A wide range of topics may be covered including soft computing (fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, etc.), data mining, machine learning, image and video processing, artificial life, robotics, etc. The exact topics to be taught will depend on the lecturers teaching the course.

This iteration of CS6208 is on Computational Game Theory.

**Course outline**

Game Theory has emerged as one of the primary tools for multi-agent decision making, with applications ranging from expert or even superhuman performance in recreational games (e.g., Poker, Starcraft, Stratego, Diplomacy) to optimal scheduling of security patrols. Compared to their single agent counterparts, the multiagent setting is much richer, with agents exhibiting strategic behavior such as lying, coercion, and collusion. This course gives an introduction to the underlying mathematics and algorithms, with a focus on the computational aspects of sequential decision making under imperfect information.

**Course content**

Strategic form games, imperfect information extensive-form games, properties of zero and general-sum games, equilibrium concepts, saddle-point problems, online learning, subgame search, incremental strategy generation, machine learning for approximate solvers, applications to security and recreational games. Depending on time constraints and interest, more advanced topics like Language Agents and Multiagent Reinforcement Learning may be included.

**Target audience**

- Students interested in multiagent decision making, e.g., multiagent RL, robotics, AI for video games, behavioral economics, and are looking to incorporate game theoretic ideas in their work.
- Students with a background in single-agent decision making and want to understand the strategic and computational implications when moving toward multiagent settings.
- Students with an interest in optimization and online learning who want to learn more about their connection with game theory.
- Board and video gamers looking to gain an advantage over their peers via “algorithmically enhanced” means, or those curious about how state-of-the-art bots work.

**Prerequisites**

Basic undergraduate linear algebra, probability, and statistics is necessary. A background in mathematical programming (e.g., linear or convex optimization), as well as basic AI and ML concepts (e.g., markov decision processes, regression) would be useful, but not required. This is a seminar class targeting PhD students. Undergraduates and Masters students with strong foundations in mathematics are welcome, but are advised to contact the instructor first.
